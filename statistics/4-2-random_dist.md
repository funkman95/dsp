[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> The numbers generated by `random.random` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability. Generate 1000 numbers from `random.random` and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

**PMF of 1000 random numbers**  
![PMF](https://github.com/funkman95/dsp/blob/master/img/random_pmf.png?raw=true)  

**CDF of 1000 random numbers**  
![CDF](https://github.com/funkman95/dsp/blob/master/img/random_cdf.png?raw=true)  

From looking at the PMF and CDF, the distribution of 1000 random numbers appears to be uniform. Although there seems to be multiple concentrations of higher frequencies in the PMF graph (portions where the lines are thicker), all of the bars are the same height meaning each has an equal probability of appearing (the "clustering" is random as well). Additionally, the CDF is approximately a straight line (linear), which also shows the distribution is uniform.

```Python
import numpy as np
import thinkstats2 as ts
import thinkplot

x = np.random.random(1000)

pmf = ts.Pmf(x)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random Variable', ylabel='pmf')
thinkplot.SaveFormat('/Users/samfunk/ds/metis/metisgh/prework/dsp/img/random_pmf', fmt='png')

cdf = ts.Cdf(x)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random Variable', ylabel='cdf')
thinkplot.SaveFormat('/Users/samfunk/ds/metis/metisgh/prework/dsp/img/random_cdf', fmt='png')
```
